# Overview
I always get lost in Minecraft. Simply put, I wanted to not get lost (without beacons). So I created this plugin to save coordinates in the game. That way I can run the command in-game and look at a list of marked locations.

# Development Environment
I used the spigot server jar, openjdk, and IntelliJ IDE to create this plugin.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I want to use a dictionary instead of an ArrayList
